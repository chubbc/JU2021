**Title:** Tensor network decoding of 2D quantum codes

**Location:** Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland

**Date:** 2021-12-06

**Abstract:** In this talk I'm going to discuss some recent work on tensor network (TN) decoders for arbitrary 2D Pauli codes. TN decoders are a powerful framework that allows one to systematically construct decoders that well-approximate the optimal decoder for large families of codes. I am going to talk about some recent work demonstrating that TN decoding for several families of 2D Pauli codes can not only be performed efficiently, but can yield state-of-the-art accuracies, in some cases out-performing bespoke code-specific decoders. Core to this is a novel TN contraction algorithm inspired by computational geometry methods, which I will also talk about.
